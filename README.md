# Dijkstra_algorithm

## Description 
The aim of this project was to implement graphs (both representations: adjacency list and adjacency matrix) with Dijkstra algorithm and then test this algorithm's computational complexity for graphs with different densities. 

## Running the code
To run the program after cloning this repository to your computer, run this command in a terminal
```
./dijkstra
```
Then type the amount of edges, the amount of vertices and the index of the vertex which will be considered in Dijkstra algorithm. The next step is inserting edges by giving for each edge three values: two indices (representing two adjacent vertices) and the value of the edge connecting them.
To choose a representation of a graph, change lines 15 and 16 in _main.cpp_ file.
